- **Step 1**

  - abstract
- **Step 3**
  - create snake class as child of reptile
- **Step 4**
  - Create a Python class

`__name__` and `__main__` are used to check if the code is run from current file/ directory for different file/ importing it
- We will create 2 files and use `__name__` and `__main__` in both files and the outcome will show the difference.
